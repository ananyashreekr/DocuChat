## Key Features:

   - Users can easily upload their PDF files.
   - The application parses the content and feeds it into Gemini LLM.
   
- **Accurate Responses**:
   - Responses are based on the actual content of the PDF, reducing hallucination by directly using parsed data.

   - Instantly ask questions about your PDF's content and receive quick answers.
   
## How it Works:

1. **Upload your PDF**: Start by selecting or dragging your PDF file to the upload section.
2. **Content Parsing**: The application extracts text and important information from the PDF.
3. **Question & Answer**: Ask any question about the documentâ€™s content, and receive answers powered by **Gemini LLM**.
4. **Reduced Hallucination**: Since the data is fed directly from the PDF, the responses are more accurate and contextually relevant.
